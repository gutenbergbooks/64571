<p class="ph3">A WORD TO THE MIDDLE CLASSES.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> may be theoretically much to sympathise
with in the cry for the yet higher culture of the
women of our middle classes, but at the same
time not a little to find fault with in practice.
While it is difficult to believe that there can
be such a thing as over-education of the human
subject, male or female, there may yet be false
lines of training, which lead to a dainty misplaced
refinement, quite incompatible with the social
position the woman may be called to fill in after-life,
and which too often presupposes, what even
education has a difficulty in supplying—a subsistence
in life. Where we equip, we too frequently
impede. In the hurry to be intelligent
and accomplished, the glitter of drawing-room
graces is an object of greater desire than the more
homely but not less estimable virtues identified
with the kitchen. Our young housewives are
imbued with far too much of the æsthete at the
expense of the cook; too much of the stage, and
too little of the home. In abandoning the equally
mistaken views of our grandfathers on women’s
up-bringing, we have gone to the opposite extreme,
to the exclusion of anything like a means to
an end; and in the blindest disregard of the
recipients’ circumstances in life, present and prospective.</p>

<p>In considering what the aim of female education
ought to be, it is surely not too much to expect
that of all things it should mentally and physically
fit our women for the battle of life. Its
application and utility should not have to end
where they practically do at present—at the altar.
While it is necessary to provide a common armour
for purposes of general defence, there certainly
ought to be a special strengthening of the harness
where most blows are to be anticipated; and if
not to all, certainly to middle-class women, the
years of battle come <i>after</i>, not before marriage.
Every one of them, then, ought to be trained in
conformity with the supreme law of her being,
to prove a real helpmate to the man that takes
her to wife. Make sure that she is first of all
thoroughly qualified for a mother’s part, in what
may be called a working sphere of life; then add
whatever graces may be desirable as a sweetening,
according to taste, means, and opportunity. It
is in this happy blending of abstract knowledge
with the economy of a home, that true success
in the education of middle-class women must be
sought.</p>

<p>In the training of our boys, utility in after-life
is seldom lost sight of. Why should it be too often
the reverse in the education of our girls, whose
great vocation in life, as wives and mothers, is a
birthright they cannot renounce, which no lord of
creation can deprive them of, and which no sticklers
for what they are pleased to call the rights of
women can logically disown? No doubt, among
the last-named there are extreme people, who
cannot, from the very nature of their own individual
circumstances, see anything in wifely cares
save the shackles of an old-world civilisation. In
their eyes, motherhood is a tax upon pleasure,
and an abasement of the sex. With them, there
need be no parley. There is no pursuit under the
sun that a woman will not freely forsake—often
at a sacrifice—for the wifely cares that supervene
on marriage; and therein, few will deny, lies her
great and natural sphere in life. Than it, there
is no nobler. In it, she can encounter no rival;
and any attempt to divest herself of nature’s
charge can have but one ending. The blandishments
of a cold æstheticism can never soothe, animate,
and brighten the human soul, like the warm,
suffusive joys which cluster round the married
state.</p>

<p>Here we may briefly digress to remark, that in
our opinion, no valid objections can be urged
against women entering professional life, <i>provided
they stick to it</i>. They already teach, and that
is neither the lightest nor least important of
masculine pursuits. Why should they not prescribe
for body and soul? why not turn their
proverbial gifts of speech to a golden account at
the bar? It would be in quitting any of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>{34}</span>
professions, and taking up the <i>rôle</i> of wife and
mother, which they would have to learn at the
expense of their own and others’ happiness, that
the real mischief of the liberty would lie. In
nine cases out of ten, their failure in the second
choice would be assured, thereby poisoning all
social well-being at its very source.</p>

<p>The woman not over- but mis-educated is
becoming an alarmingly fruitful cause of the
downward tendencies of much of our middle-class
society. She herself is less to blame for this, than
the short-sighted, though possibly well-meant policy
of her parents and guardians, who, in the worst
spirit of the age, veneer their own flesh and
blood, as they do their furniture, for appearance’
sake. Let us glance at the educational equipment
they provide their girls with, always premising
that our remarks are to be held as strictly
applicable only to the middle ranks of our
complex society.</p>

<p>Our typical young woman receives a large
amount of miscellaneous education, extending far
through her teens, and amounting to a very fair
mastery of the <i>R</i>s. If she limp in any of these, it
will be in the admittedly vexatious processes of
arithmetic. She will have a pretty ready command
of the grammatical and idiomatic uses of her
mother-tongue; a fairly firm hold of the geography
of this planet, and an intelligent conception
of the extra-terrestrial system. She will
have plodded through piles of French and
German courses, learning many things from them
but the language. She will have a fair if not
profound knowledge of history. She can, in all
likelihood, draw a little, and even paint; but of
all her accomplishments, what she must imperatively
excel in is music. From tender years,
she will have diligently laboured at all the
musical profundities; and her chances in the
matrimonial market of the future are probably
regarded as being in proportion to her proficient
manipulation of the keyboard. If she
can sing, well and good; play on the piano she
must. If, as a girl, she has no taste for instrumental
music, and no ear to guide her flights
in harmony, the more reason why she should,
with the perseverance of despair, thump away
on the irresponsive ivories, in defiance of every
instinct in her being. The result at twenty
<i>may</i> be something tangible in some cases, but
extremely unsatisfactory at the price.</p>

<p>During all these years, she has been systematically
kept ignorant of almost every domestic care.
Of the commonplaces of cookery she has not the
remotest idea. A great educationist, whose statement
we have good reason to indorse, asserts
that there are thousands of our young housewives
that do not know how to cook a potato. This
may seem satire. It is, we fear, in too many
cases, true, and we quote it with a view to
correct rather than chastise.</p>

<p>The misapplications of young miss’s upbringing
do not end here. She cannot sew to any purpose.
If she deign to use a needle at all, it is to
embroider a smoking-cap for a lover or a pair
of slippers for papa. To sew on a button, or
cut out and unite the plainest piece of male
or female clothing, is not always within her
powers, or at least her inclinations. Prosaic
vulgar work, fit only for dressmakers and milliners!
She will spend weeks and months over
eighteen inches of what she is pleased to call
lace, while the neighbouring seamstress is making
up all her underclothing, to pay for which, papa
has not too much money; but then it is genteel.</p>

<p>She cannot knit. A pair of worsted cuffs or
a lanky cravat is something great to attain to;
while a stocking, even were the charwomen less
easily paid, is sure to come off the needles right-lined
as any of Euclid’s parallelograms—all leg
and no ankle—a suspicion of foot, but never a
vestige of heel. To darn the hole that so soon
appears in the loosely knitted fabric, would be
a servile, reproachful task, quite staggering to
the sentimental aspirations of our engaged
Angelina. Yet darning and the divine art of
mending will one day be to her a veritable
philosopher’s stone, whose magic influences will
shed beams of happiness over her household, and
fortunate will she be if she have not to seek it
with tears.</p>

<p>By the sick-bed, where she ought to be supreme,
she is often worse than useless. The pillows that
harden on the couch of convalescence, too rarely
know her softening touch. She may be all kindness
and attention—for the natural currents of
her being are full to repletion of sweetness and
sympathy—yet as incapable of really skilled service
as an artist’s lay-figure. And, as a last touch to
the sorry picture, instead of being in any way a
source of comfort to the bread-winners of her
family, or a lessening of the strain on their purse-strings,
she is a continual cause of extra work to
servants, of anxiety to her parents, of <i>ennui</i> to
herself.</p>

<p>Apparently, the chief mission of the young
lady to whom we address ourselves, is to entice
some eligible young man into the responsibilities
of wedlock. He, poor fellow, succumbs not so
much to intrinsic merits, as to fine lady-like airs.
He sees the polish on the surface, and takes for
granted that there is good solid wear underneath.
Our young miss has conquered, and quits the
family roof-tree, sweetly conscious of her orange
wreath of victory; but alas!—we are sorry to say
it—do not her conquests too often end at the altar,
unless she resolutely set herself to learn the
exacting mysteries of her new sphere, and, what
is far more difficult, to unlearn much that she
has acquired? That she often does at this stage
make a bold and firm departure from the toyish
fancies of her training, and makes, from the sheer
plasticity and devotion of her character, wonderful
strides in the housewife’s craft, we cheerfully
confess. Were it otherwise, the domestic framework
of society would be in a far more disorganised
condition than it happily is. But why handicap
her for the most important, most arduous portion
of her race in life? Why train her to be the
vapid fine lady, with almost the certainty that,
by so doing, you are taking the surest means of
rendering her an insufficient wife and mother?
And, unfortunately, not always, in fact but
seldom, is she able, when she crosses her husband’s,
threshold, to tear herself away from her omnivorous
novel-reading, piano-playing, and all the
other alleviations of confirmed idleness.</p>

<p>The sweets of the honeymoon and an undefined
vacation beyond make no great calls on her as
a helpmate and wife. If her husband’s means
permit of a servant or two, the smoother the water
and the plainer the sailing for the nonce; although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>{35}</span>
these keen-scented critics in the kitchen will, in
a very short time, detect and take the grossest
advantage of their mistress’s inexperience. Besides,
if we reflect that among our middle classes more
marry on an income of two hundred pounds
than on a higher, it becomes painfully apparent
that two or three servants are the one thing our
young housewife needs, but cannot possibly
afford.</p>

<p>She is now, however, only about to begin her
life-work, and if there is such a thing clearly
marked out for a being on this globe, it is for
woman. By birthright, she is the mother of the
human race. Could she have a greater, grander
field for enterprise? How admirably has nature
fitted her for performing the functions of the
mother and adorning the province of the wife!
Hence, there devolves upon her a responsibility
which no extraneous labour in more inviting
fields can excuse. No philosophy, no tinkering
of the constitution, no success in the misnamed
higher walks of life and knowledge, will atone
for the failure of the mother. Let her shine a
social star of the first magnitude, let her be
supreme in every intellectual circle, and then
marry, as she is ever prone to do, in spite of all
theories; and if she fail as a mother, she fails
as a woman and as a human being. She becomes
a mere rag, a tatter of nature’s cast-off clothing,
spiritless, aimless, a failure in this great world
of work.</p>

<p>As her family increases, the household shadows
deepen, where all should be purity, sweetness,
and light. The domestic ship may even founder
through the downright, culpable incapacity of her
that takes the helm. Her children never have
the air of comfort and cleanliness. In their
clothes, the stitch is never in time. The wilful
neglect, and consequent waste, in this one matter
of half-worn clothing is almost incredible. A
slatternly atmosphere pervades her entire home.
With the lapse of time our young wife becomes
gradually untidy, dishevelled, and even dirty, in
her own person; and at last sits down for good,
disconsolate and overwhelmed by her unseen foe.
Her husband can find no pleasure in the ‘hugger-mugger,’
as Carlyle phrases it, of his home; there
is no brightness in it to cheer his hours of rest.
He returns from his daily labours to a chaos,
which he shuns by going elsewhere; and so the
sequel of misery and neglect takes form.</p>

<p>As a first precaution against such a calamity, let
us strip our home-life of every taint of quackery.
Let us regard women’s education, like that of men,
as a means to a lifelong end, never forgetting that
if we unfit it for everyday practice, we render it a
mere useless gem, valuable in a sense, but unset.
Middle-class women will be the better educated,
in every sense, the more skilled they are in the
functions of the mother and the duties of the
wife. Give them every chance of proving thrifty
wives and good mothers, in addition to, or, where
that is impossible, to the exclusion of accomplished
brides. Let some part of their training
as presently constituted, such as the rigours of
music, and the fritterings of embroidery, give
way, in part, to the essential acquirements which
every woman, every mother should possess, and
which no gold can buy. Give us a woman, then,
natural in her studies, her training, her vocations,
and her dress, and in the words of the
wisest of men, who certainly had a varied
experience of womankind, we shall have something
‘far more precious than rubies. She
will not be afraid of the snow for her household;
strength and honour will be her clothing;
her husband shall have no need of spoil; he
shall be known in the gates, when he sitteth
among the elders; he shall praise her; and her
children shall call her blessed.’</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.—IN THE OAK PARLOUR.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> so, it had been only a bit of Uncle Dick’s
kindly forethought and common-sense which had
prompted the alarming words he had spoken
to Madge. How she and Philip laughed at the
chimerical idea that there could be any possible
combination of circumstances in time or space
which could alter their thoughts regarding each
other! The birds in the orchard, in the intervals
of pecking the fruit, seemed to sing a joyous
laughing chorus at the absurdity of it—notwithstanding
that the admission of it might be
prudent.</p>

<p>But when they came down to the point of
vague admission that in the abstract and in
relation to other couples—of course it could not
apply to their own case—Uncle Dick’s counsel was
such as prudent young people about to separate
should keep in mind, an expression of perplexity
flitted across Madge’s face. She looked at him
with those tenderly wistful serious eyes, half
doubting whether or not to utter the thought
which had come to her.</p>

<p>‘But what I cannot understand,’ she said
slowly, ‘is why Uncle Dick should have been
in such a temper. You know that although he
may fly into a passion at anything that seems
to him wrong, he never keeps it up. Now he
had all the time riding home from Kingshope
to cool, and yet when he spoke to me he seemed
to be as angry as if he had just come out of
the room where the quarrel took place.’</p>

<p>‘What can it matter to us?’ was the blithe
response. ‘He is not angry with me or with you,
and so long as that is the case we need not mind
if he should quarrel with all creation.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll tell you what we will do,’ she said,
and the disappearance of all perplexity from her
face showed that she was quite of his opinion,
although she wanted to have it supported by
another authority.</p>

<p>‘What is that?’</p>

<p>‘We will go in and ask Aunt Hessy what she
thinks about it.... Are you aware, sir’ (this
with a pretty assumption of severity), ‘that you
have not seen aunty to-day, and that you have
not even inquired about her?’</p>

<p>‘That <i>is</i> bad,’ he muttered; but it was evident
that the badness which he felt was the interruption
of the happy wandering through the orchard
by this summary recall to duty.</p>

<p>In his remorse, however, he was ready to sacrifice
his present pleasure; for Aunt Hessy was
a stanch friend of theirs, and it might be that
her cheery way of looking at things would dispel
the last lingering cloud of doubt from Madge’s
mind regarding the misunderstanding between
his father and Uncle Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>{36}</span></p>

<p>‘Then we had better go in at once; we shall
find her in the dairy.’</p>

<p>Mrs Crawshay was superintending the operations
of three buxom maidens who were scalding
the large cans in which the milk was conveyed
every morning to the metropolis. Her
ruddy face with the quiet, kindly gray eyes
was that of a woman in her prime, and even
her perfectly white hair did not detract from the
sense of youth which was expressed in her appearance:
it was an additional charm. She was
nearly sixty. Her age was a standing joke of
Uncle Dick’s. He had made the discovery that
she was a month older than himself, and he
magnified it into a year.</p>

<p>‘Can’t you see?’ he would say, ‘if you are
born in December and I am born in January, that
makes exactly a year’s difference?’</p>

<p>Then there would be a loud guffaw, and Uncle
Dick would feel that he had completely overcome
the Missus. The words and the guffaw were as a
rule simultaneous, and if nobody happened to be
present, it usually ended in Uncle Dick putting
his arm round her neck and saying with a lump
in his throat: ‘My old lass—young always to
me.’</p>

<p>He had not the slightest notion of the poetry
that was in his soul whilst he spoke.</p>

<p>Mrs Crawshay believed in young love. She had
been very happy in hers. She had been brought
up on a farm. Lads had come about her of course,
and she had put them aside with a—‘Nay, lad,
I’m not for thee,’ and had thought no more about
them. Then Dick Crawshay had come, and—she
did not know why—she had said: ‘Yes, thou
art my lad.’</p>

<p>They had been very happy notwithstanding
their losses—indeed the losses seemed to have
drawn them closer together.</p>

<p>‘It’s only you and me, my old lass,’ he would
say in their privacy.</p>

<p>‘Only you and me, Dick,’ she would say as
her gray head rested on his breast with all the
emotion of youth in her heart.</p>


<p class="p2">‘Go into the oak parlour,’ said Mrs Crawshay
cheerily to the young folks, when she understood
their mission; ‘and I’ll be with you in a
minute.’</p>

<p>The oak parlour was the stateroom of the
house. It was long and high; the oak of the
panels and beams which supported the pointed
roof were of that dark hue which only time can
impart. The three narrow windows had been
lengthened by Dick’s father, and when the moon
shone through them they were like three white
ghosts looking in upon the dark chamber. But
the moon did not often get a chance of doing this,
for there was only a brief period of the year
during which there was not a huge fire blazing
in the great old-fashioned ingle. There were
four portraits of former Crawshays and three
of famous horses; with these exceptions the walls
were bare, for none of the family had ever been
endowed with much love of art.</p>

<p>There were some legends still current about
the mysteries hidden behind the sombre panels.
One of the panels was specially honoured because
it was reputed to have a recess behind it in which
the king had found shelter for a time during his
flight from the Roundheads. But owing to the
indifference or carelessness of successive generations,
nobody was now quite sure to which of
the panels this honour properly belonged. There
had been occasional attempts made to discover
the royal hiding-place, but they had hitherto
failed.</p>

<p>The furniture was plain and substantial, displaying
the styles of several periods of manufacture.
In spite of the stiff straight lines of
most of the things in the room, the red curtains,
the red table-cover, the odd variety of the chairs
gave the place a homely and, when the fire was
ablaze, a cosy expression. This stateroom was
correctly called ‘parlour,’ and it had been the
scene of many a revel.</p>

<p>As Philip and Madge were on their way to
the oak parlour, a servant presented a card to
the latter.</p>

<p>‘He asked for you, miss,’ said the girl, and
passed on to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Madge looked at the card, and instantly held
it out to Philip.</p>

<p>‘Hullo!—my father,’ ejaculated he, adding with
a laugh: ‘Now you can see that this mountain
of yours is not even a molehill.’</p>

<p>‘How can you tell that?’</p>

<p>‘Because my father is the reverse of Uncle
Dick. He never forgets—I doubt if he ever
forgives—an unpleasant word. And yet here he
is. Come along at once—but we had better say
nothing to him about the affair unless he speaks
of it himself.’</p>

<p>They entered the room together, smiling hopefully.</p>

<p>Mr Lloyd Hadleigh was standing at a window,
hat in one hand, slim umbrella in the other, and
staring hard at the shrubs. He had a way of
staring hard at everything, and yet the way was
so calm and thoughtful that he did not appear
to see anything or anybody, and thus the stare
was not offensive.</p>

<p>‘The guv’nor always seems to be dreaming
about you when he looks at you, and you never
know when he’s going to speak—that’s awk’ard,’
was the description of his expression given by
Caleb Kersey, one of the occasional labourers on
Ringsford.</p>

<p>He was a man of average height, firmly built;
square face; thick black moustache; close cropped
black hair, with only an indication of thinning
on the top and showing few streaks of white. His
age was not more than fifty, and he had attained
the full vigour of life.</p>

<p>‘People talk about the fire and “go” of thirty,’
he would say in his dry way. ‘It is nonsense.
At that age a man is either going downhill or
going up it, and in either case he is too much
occupied and worried to have time to be happy.
That was the most miserable period of my
life.’</p>

<p>Coldness was the first impression of his outward
character. No one had ever seen him in a passion.
Successful in business, he had provided well for
the five children of a very early marriage. He
never referred to that event, and had been long
a widower without showing the slightest inclination
to establish a new mistress at Ringsford.</p>

<p>He turned on the entrance of Madge and Philip,
saluting the former with grave politeness; then
to the latter: ‘There are some letters for you
at home, Philip.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>{37}</span></p>

<p>‘Thank you, sir; but I have no doubt they
can wait. I am to stay for dinner here.’</p>

<p>‘From the postmarks I judge they are of
importance.’</p>

<p>‘Ah—then I know who they are from, and in
that case there is no hurry at all, for the mail
does not leave until Monday.’</p>

<p>Mr Hadleigh addressed himself to Madge—no
sign of annoyance in voice or manner.</p>

<p>‘May I be permitted to have a few minutes’
conversation with you in private, Miss Heathcote?’</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon, sir,’ broke in Philip hastily;
‘I did not understand you to mean that you
found me in the way.—If your aunt should ask
for me, Miss Heathcote, I shall be in the
garden.’</p>

<p>With a good-natured inclination of the head,
he went out. And as he walked down the
garden path filling his pipe, he muttered to
himself thoughtfully: ‘Seems to me he grows
queerer and queerer every day. What <i>can</i> be
the matter with him? If anybody else had
asked for a private interview so solemnly, I
should have taken it for granted that he was
going to propose.... Daresay he wants to give
some explanation of that confounded row, and
make his apologies through Madge. I should
like him to do that.’</p>

<p>But Mr Hadleigh was neither going to propose
nor to make apologies. He smiled, a curious sort
of half-sad, half-amused smile, and there was really
something interesting in the expression of his eyes
at the moment.</p>

<p>‘The truth is, Miss Heathcote, that I cannot
acknowledge weakness before Philip. He is such
a reckless fellow about money, that he would tell
me I ought to give in at once to the labourers.’</p>

<p>‘I am sure he would not, Mr Hadleigh, if he
thought you were in the right.’</p>

<p>‘I am not one likely to hold out if convinced
that I am in the wrong.’</p>

<p>‘Few men do under these conditions, Mr
Hadleigh,’ said Madge, smiling.</p>

<p>‘Well, at anyrate, I want your assistance very
much; will you give it?’</p>

<p>‘With great pleasure, if it is worth anything
to you.’</p>

<p>‘It is worth everything; for what harvest I
might have on the home-farm—and I understand
it promises to be a good one—is likely to be lost
unless you help me.’</p>

<p>‘How can that be, Mr Hadleigh?’</p>

<p>‘Through beer. This is how the matter stands.
You know the dispute about the wages, and I am
willing to give in to that. But on this question
of beer in the field I am firm. The men and
women shall have the price of it; but I will
neither give beer on the field nor permit them
to bring it there. A great reform is to be worked
in this matter, and I mean to do what little I
can to advance it. I am sure, Miss Heathcote,
you must acknowledge that I am right in adhering
to this resolution.’</p>

<p>‘I have been brought up in some very old-fashioned
notions, Mr Hadleigh,’ she answered
with pretty evasiveness.</p>

<p>‘There is a high principle at stake in it, my
dear Miss Heathcote, and it is worth fighting
for.’</p>

<p>‘But I do not yet see how my services are to
be of use to you,’ she said, anxious to avoid this
debatable subject. It was one on which her
uncle had quite different views from those of
Mr Hadleigh. And, therefore, she could not
altogether sympathise with the latter’s enthusiasm,
eager as she was to see the people steady
and sober, for she remembered at the moment
that he had made a considerable portion of his
fortune out of a brewery.</p>

<p>‘That was exactly what I was about to explain,’
he replied. ‘I came to beg you to speak to Caleb
Kersey.’</p>

<p>‘Caleb!—why, he never touches anything
stronger than tea.’</p>

<p>‘That may be; but he believes that other people
have a right to do so if they like. He has persuaded
every man and woman who comes to me
or my bailiff to put the question: “Is there to
be beer?” When they are answered: “No; but
the money,” they turn on their heels and march
off, so that at this moment we have only two men.
Now, my dear Miss Heathcote, will you persuade
Kersey to stop his interference?’</p>

<p>‘I do not see that he is interfering; but I will
speak to him.’</p>

<p>‘Thanks, thanks. If you were with me I
should have no difficulty.’</p>

<p>‘You would find me a very bad second,’ she
answered, laughing, ‘for I should say—submit
to old customs until persuasion alters them, since
force never can.’</p>

<p>Two things struck Madge during this interview
and the commonplaces about nothing which
followed it: The first, how much more frank
and at ease he seemed to be with her than with
any one else; and the second was, how loath he
seemed to go.</p>

<p>The owner of Ringsford said to himself as he
was driven away: ‘I shall be glad when she is
Philip’s wife.’</p>


<h3>CHAPTER V.—A NEW EDEN.</h3>

<p>She was still standing at the door to which
she had accompanied Mr Hadleigh, and was
looking after him, when a kindly voice behind
her said: ‘He does look a woeful man. I wonder
if he has any real friends.’</p>

<p>Madge turned. Aunt Hessy was standing there,
a pitying expression on her comely face, and
she was wiping her hands in her apron. There
was nothing in Mrs Crawshay’s manner or appearance
to indicate her Quaker antecedents, except
the frequent use of thee and thou—she did not
always use that form of speech—and the quiet
tone of all the colours of her dress. Yet, until
her marriage she had been, like her father, a good
Wesleyan; after her marriage she accompanied
her husband to the church in which his family
had kept their place for so many generations.
To her simple faith it was the same whether
she worshipped in church or chapel.</p>

<p>‘Why do you say that, aunt?’</p>

<p>‘Because he seems to be so much alone.’</p>

<p>‘Mr Hadleigh alone! What about all the people
who visit the manor?’</p>

<p>‘Ay, they visit the manor,’ answered Aunt
Hessy, with a slight shake of the head and a
quiet smile.</p>

<p>That set Madge thinking. He did impress her
as a solitary man, notwithstanding his family,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>{38}</span>
his many visitors, his school treats, his flower-shows,
and other signs of a busy and what ought
to be a happy life. Then there was the strange
thing that he should come to ask her assistance
to enable him to come to terms with the
harvesters.</p>

<p>‘I believe you are right, aunt. He is very
much alone, and I suppose that was why he
came to me to-day.’</p>

<p>‘What did he want?’ asked Dame Crawshay,
with unusual quickness and an expression of
anxiety Madge could not remember ever having
seen on her face before. She did not understand
it until long afterwards.</p>

<p>Having explained the object of Mr Hadleigh’s
visit, as she understood it, she was surprised to
see how much relieved her aunt looked. Knowing
that that good woman had never had a secret
in her life, and never made the least mystery
about anything, she put the question direct:
‘Did you expect him to say anything else?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know, Madge. He is a queer man,
Mr Hadleigh, in a-many ways. He spoke to your
uncle about this, and he would have nothing
to do with it.’</p>

<p>‘And that is why they fell out at the market,
I suppose.’</p>

<p>‘Where is Philip? He must take after his
mother, for he is straightforward in everything.’</p>

<p>‘He is out in the garden. Shall I go for
him?’</p>

<p>‘Nay. I want more peas, so we can find him
on our way for them.’</p>

<p>Philip had not gone far. He had walked down
to the duck-pond; but after that distant excursion,
he kept near the little gate beside the dairy,
glancing frequently at the house-door. He was
dallying with the last hours of the bright morning
of his love, and he grudged every moment that
Madge was away from him. A few days hence
he would be looking back to this one with longing
eyes. How miserable he would be on board that
ship! How he would hate the sound of the
machinery, knowing that every stroke of the
piston was taking him so much farther away
from her. And then, as the waters widened and
stretched into the sky, would not his heart sink,
and would he not wish that he had never started
on this weary journey?</p>

<p>In response to that lover-like question, he heard
the echo of Madge’s voice in his brain: ‘It was
your mother’s wish.’</p>

<p>This simple reminder was enough, for he
cherished the sad memory of that sweet pale face,
which smiled upon him hopefully a moment
before it became calm in death.</p>

<p>He sprang away from these sorrowful reflections.
Yes; he would look back longingly to
this day when sea and sky shut out Willowmere
and Madge from sight. But they would both be
palpable to his mental vision; and he would look
forward to that still brighter day of his return,
his mission fulfilled, and nothing to do but
marry Madge and live happy ever after. Ay, that
should comfort him and make the present parting
bearable.</p>

<p>Besides, who could say with what fortune he
might come back? The uncle to whom he was
going was rumoured to be the possessor of fabulous
wealth, and although married he was childless.
True, also, he was reported to be so eccentric
that nobody could understand him, or form the
slightest conception of how he would act under
any given circumstances. But it was known that
before he went abroad, his sister—Philip’s mother—had
been the one creature in whom all his
affection seemed to be concentrated. An inexplicable
coldness appeared in his conduct towards her
after her marriage. The reason had never been
explained.</p>

<p>Shortly before her death, however, there had
come a letter from him, which made her very
happy. But she had burned the letter, by his
instructions, without showing it to any one or
revealing its contents. Evidently it was this
letter which induced her to lay upon her son
the charge of going to her brother Austin Shield,
whenever he should be summoned. But the
uncle held no correspondence with any one at
Ringsford. That he was still alive, could be only
surmised from vague reports and the fact that on
every anniversary of Mrs Hadleigh’s birthday,
with one exception, a fresh wreath of flowers was
found on her grave—placed there, it was believed,
by his orders. Then a few months ago, a letter
had come to Philip, containing an invitation
from his uncle, suggesting possible advantages, and
inclosing a draft for expenses. So, being summoned,
he was going; and whether the result
should be good or ill fortune, his mother’s last
command would be obeyed, and he would return
with a clear conscience to marry Madge.</p>

<p>That thought kept him in good-humour throughout
the weary ages which seemed to elapse before
he saw Madge and her aunt approaching. He
ran to meet them.</p>

<p>‘I thought you were never coming,’ was his
exclamation.</p>

<p>‘Thou’lt be able to do without her for a longer
time than this without troubling thyself, by-and-by,’
said Dame Crawshay with one of her pleasant
smiles.</p>

<p>‘When that day comes, I will say you are a
prophetess of evil,’ he retorted, laughing, but with
an air of affectionate respect. That was the feeling
with which she inspired everybody.</p>

<p>‘Nay, lad; but it need not be evil, for you may
be apart, surely, doing good for each other.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; but not without wishing we were
together.’</p>

<p>‘Wilt ever be wishing that?’</p>

<p>‘For ever and ever.’</p>

<p>He answered with burlesque solemnity outwardly;
but Madge knew that he spoke from his
heart, and in the full faith of his words. She gave
him a quiet glance with those soft wistful eyes,
and he was very happy.</p>

<p>They had reached a tall row of peas, at which
Dame Crawshay had been already busy that
morning, as a wooden chair placed beside it
indicated. Here she seated herself, and began
to pluck the peas, shelling them as she plucked;
then dropping the pods into her lap and the peas
into a basin. She performed the operation with
mechanical regularity, which did not in any way
interfere with conversation.</p>

<p>Madge, kneeling beside her, helped with nimble
fingers; and Philip, hands clasped behind him,
stood looking on admiringly. The sun was
shining upon them; and, darting shafts of light
through the surrounding trees, made bright spots<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>{39}</span>
amidst the moving shadows underneath. Everything
seemed to be still and sleepy. The breeze
was so light that there was only a gentle rustle
of leaves, and through it was heard the occasional
thud of an over-ripe apple or pear as it fell, and
the drowsy hum of the bees.</p>

<p>Light, warmth, peace. ‘Ah,’ thought Philip,
‘if we could only go on this way always! If we
could fix ourselves thus as in a photograph, what
a blessed Eden this would be!’</p>

<p>‘Thou’dst find it dull soon, Philip, standing
there looking at us shelling peas, if thou wert
forced to do it,’ said Dame Crawshay, looking
up at him with a curious smile.</p>

<p>‘That shows you cannot guess my thoughts.
They were of quite a different nature, for I was
wishing that there had been some fixing process
in nature, so that there might never be any change
in our present positions.’</p>

<p>Madge looked as if she had been thinking
something very similar; but she went on silently
shelling peas; and a sunbeam shooting through
a gap in the green pea hedge, made a golden
radiance on her face.</p>

<p>‘Eh, deary me, what love will do!’ exclaimed
the dame, laughing, but shaking her head regretfully,
as if sorry that she could not look at things
in the same hopeful humour. ‘Other people have
talked like that in the heyday of life. Some have
found a little of their hope fulfilled; many have
found none of it: all have found that they had
to give up the thought of a great deal of what
they expected. Some take their disappointment
with wise content and make the best of things
as they find them. They jog along as happily
as mortals may, like Dick and me; a-many kick
against the pricks and suffer sorely for it; but
all have to give in sooner or later, and own that
the world could not get along if everybody could
arrange it to suit his own pleasure.’</p>

<p>How gently this good-natured philosopher
brought them down from the clouds to what
foolish enthusiasts call contemptuously ‘the
common earth.’ Sensible people use the same
phrase, but they use it respectfully, knowing
that this ‘common earth’ may be made beautiful
or ugly as their own actions instruct their
vision.</p>

<p>To Philip it was quite true that most people
sought something they could never attain; that
many people fancied they had found the something
they wanted, and discovered afterwards, to
their sorrow, that they had not found the thing
at all. But then, you see, it was an entirely
different condition of affairs in his case. He had
found what he wanted, and knew that there could
be no mistake about it.</p>

<p>To Madge, her aunt’s wisdom appeared to be
very cold and even wrong in some respects, considering
the placid and happy experiences of her
own life. She had her great faith in Philip—her
dream of a life which should be made up of
devotion to him under any circumstances of joy
or sorrow, and she could not believe that it was
possible that their experience should be as full
of crosses as that of others. And yet there was
a strange faintness at her heart, as if she were
vaguely conscious that there were possibilities
which neither she nor Philip could foresee or
understand.</p>

<p>‘We shall be amongst the wise folk,’ said Philip
confidently, ‘and take things as they come, contentedly.
We shall be easily contented, so long
as we are true to each other—and I don’t think
you imagine there is any chance of a mistake in
that respect.’</p>

<p>Aunt Hessy went on shelling peas for a time
in silence. There was a thoughtful expression on
her kindly face, and there was even a suggestion
of sadness in it. Here were two young people—so
young, so happy, so full of faith in each other—just
starting on that troublous journey called
Life, and she had to speak those words of warning
which always seem so harsh to the pupils, until,
after bitter experience, they look back and say:
‘If I had only taken the warning in time, what
might have been?’</p>

<p>By-and-by she spoke very softly: ‘Thou art
thinking, Madge, that I am croaking; and thou,
Philip, are thinking the same.... Nay, there
is no need to deny it. But I do not mean to
dishearten thee. All I want is to make thee
understand that there are many things we reckon
as certain in the heyday of life, that never come
to us.’</p>

<p>‘I daresay,’ said Philip, plucking a pea-pod
and chewing it savagely; ‘but don’t you think,
Mrs Crawshay, that this is very like throwing
cold-water on us, and that throwing cold-water
is very apt to produce the misadventure which
you think possible?—that is, that something might
happen to alter our plans?’</p>

<p>‘I am sorry for that, lad; I do not mean to
throw cold-water on thee; but rather to help
thee and to help Madge to look at things in a
sensible way. Listen. I had a friend once who
was like Madge; and she had a friend who was,
as it might be, like you, Philip. He went away,
as you are going, to seek his fortune in foreign
parts. There was a blunder between them,
and she got wedded to another man. Her first
lad came back, and finding how things were, he
went away again and never spoke more to her.’</p>

<p>‘They must have been miserable.’</p>

<p>‘For a while they were miserable enough; but
they got over it.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll be bound the man never married.’</p>

<p>‘There thou’dst be bound wrong. He did
marry, and is now wealthy and prosperous, though
she was taken away in a fever long ago.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, but is he happy?’</p>

<p>‘That is only known to himself and Him that
knows us all.’</p>

<p>‘Well, for our future I will trust Madge,’ said
Philip, taking her hand, ‘in spite of all your
forebodings; and she will trust me.’</p>

<p>Dame Crawshay had filled her basin with peas,
and she rose.</p>

<p>‘God bless thee, Philip, wherever thou goest,
and make thy hopes realities,’ she said with what
seemed to the lovers unnecessary solemnity.</p>

<p>The dame went into the house. Madge and
Philip went down the meadow, and under the
willows by the merry river, forgot that there was
any parting before them or any danger that their
fortunes might be crossed.</p>

<p>Those bright days! Can they ever come again,
or can any future joy be so full, so perfect?
There are no love-speeches—little talk of any
kind, and what there is, is commonplace enough.
There is no need for speech. There is only—only!—the
sense of the dear presence that makes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>{40}</span>
all the world beautiful, leaving the heart nothing
more to desire.</p>

<p>But the dreams in the sunshine there under
the willows, with the river murmuring sympathetic
harmonies at their feet! The dreams of a future,
and yet no future; for it is always to be as now.
Can it be possible that this man and woman
will ever look coldly on each other—ever speak
angry, passionate words? Can it be possible
that there will ever flit across their minds one
instant’s regret that they had come together?</p>

<p>No, no: the dreams are of the future; but
the future will be always as now—full of faith
and gladness.</p>

CHELLY.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fourth and most southerly iron link of
railway which will soon stretch across the North
American continent from ocean to ocean is
rapidly approaching completion along the thirty-fifth
parallel; already it has reached the San
Francisco mountains in its course to the Pacific.
While avoiding the chances of blockade by
snow, liable in higher latitudes, it has struck
through a little explored region among the
vast plains of Arizona and New Mexico. It is
not easy at once to realise the extent of table-lands,
greater in area than Great Britain and
Ireland, upon which no soul has a settled habitation.
The sun beats down with terrible force on
these dry undulating plains, where at most times
nothing relieves the eye, as it wanders away to
the dim horizon, save a few cactus and sage-bush
plants. But at seasons, heavy rains change dry
gulches into roaring torrents, and parched lowlands
into broad lakes, covering the country with
a fine grass, on which millions of sheep, horses,
and cattle are herded by wandering Navajo and
Moqui Indians. To the periodical rains, as well
as to geological convulsions, are traced the causes
of those wondrous chasms, which in places break
abruptly the rolling surface of the prairie, and
extend in rocky gorges for many miles. They are
called cañons. The grandeur of the scenery found
in one of them, Cañon de Chelly, can scarcely
be overstated.</p>

<p>Cañon de Chelly—pronounced Canyon de Shay—is
in the north of Arizona. It takes its name
from a Frenchman, who is said to have been the
first white man to set foot within its walls; but
except the record of a recent visit by the United
States Geological Survey, no account of it seems
to have hitherto appeared. The picturesque
features of this magnificent ravine are unrivalled;
and what lends a more fascinating interest, is the
existence, among its rocky walls, of dwellings
once occupied by a race of men, who, dropping
into the ocean of the past with an unwritten
history, are only known to us as cave-dwellers.</p>

<p>In October 1882, an exploring party, headed
by Professor Stevenson of the Ethnological
Bureau, Washington, and escorted by a number
of soldiers and Indian guides, set out for this
remarkable spot. One of the party, Lieutenant
T. V. Keam, has furnished the following details
of their investigations. After travelling one hundred
and twenty miles out from the nearest
military post, Fort Defiance, and crossing a desert
some twenty miles broad, the entrance to Cañon
de Chelly was reached. The bed of the ravine
is entirely composed of sand, which is constantly
being blown along it, with pitiless force, by
sudden gusts of wind. The walls of the cañon
are red sandstone; at first, but some fifty feet
high, they increase gradually, until at eighteen
miles they reach an elevation of twelve hundred
feet, which is about the highest point, and continue
without decreasing for at least thirty miles.
The first night, Professor Stevenson’s party camped
three miles from the mouth of the cañon, under
a grove of cotton-wood trees, and near a clear
flowing stream of water. Here the scene was an
impressive one. A side ravine of great magnitude
intersected the main cañon, and at the junction
there stood out, like a sentinel, far from the rest
of the cliff, one solemn brown stone shaft eight
hundred feet high. In the morning, continuing
the journey through the awful grandeur of the
gorge, the walls still increased in height, some
having a smooth and beautifully coloured surface
reaching to one thousand feet; others, from the
action of water, sand storms, and atmospheric
effects, cut and broken into grand arches, battlements,
and spires of every conceivable shape. At
times would be seen an immense opening in
the wall, stretching back a quarter of a mile,
the sides covered with verdure of different shades,
reaching to the summit, where tall firs with
giant arms seemed dwarfed to the size of a puny
gooseberry bush, and the lordly oak was only
distinguished by the beautiful sheen of its
leaves.</p>

<p>On the second night the camp was formed at
the base of a cliff, in which were descried, planted
along a niche at a height of nearly one hundred
feet, some cliff-dwellings. Next morning, these
were reached after a dangerous climb, by means
of a rope thrown across a projecting stick, up
the almost perpendicular sides of this stupendous
natural fortress. The village was perched on its
narrow ledge of rock, facing the south, and was
overshadowed by an enormous arch, formed in
the solid side of the cañon. Overlapping the ruins
for at least fifty feet, at a height above them of
sixty feet, it spread its protecting roof five hundred
feet from end to end. No moisture ever
penetrated beyond the edge of this red shield of
nature; and to its shelter, combined with the dryness
of the atmosphere and preserving nature of
the sand, is to be attributed the remarkable state of
preservation, after such a lapse of time, in which
the houses of the cliff-dwellers were found. Some
of them still stood three stories high, built in
compact form, close together within the extremely
limited space, the timber used to support the roof
being in some cases perfectly sound. The white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>{41}</span>
stone employed is gypsum, cut with stone implements,
but having the outer edges smoothly dressed
and evenly laid up; the stones of equal size placed
parallel with each other presenting a uniform
and pleasing appearance.</p>

<p>No remains of importance were found here,
excepting a finely woven sandal, and some pieces
of netting made from the fibre of the yucca plant.
But on proceeding two miles farther up the
cañon, another group of ruins was discovered,
which contained relics of a very interesting character.
The interior of some of the larger houses
was painted with a series of red bands and
squares, fresh in colour, and contained fragments
of ornamented pottery, besides what appeared to
be pieces of blankets made from birds’ feathers;
these, perhaps, in ages past bedecked the shoulders
of some red beauty, when the grim old walls
echoed the fierce war-songs of a long-lost nation.
But the most fortunate find at this spot, and the
first of that description made in the country, was
a cyst, constructed of timber smoothly plastered
on the inside, containing remains of three of the
ancient cliff-dwellers. One was in a sitting posture,
the skin of the thighs and legs being in a
perfect state of preservation. These ruins, as in
the former case, were protected from the weather
by an overhanging arch of rock.</p>

<p>At several points on the journey through
Cañon de Chelly, hieroglyphics were traced, graven
on the cliff wall. Most of the designs were
unintelligible; but figures of animals, such as
the bear and mountain sheep or goat, were prominent.
Another cliff village was observed of a
considerable size, but planted three hundred feet
above the cañon bed, in such a position that it
is likely to remain sacred from the foot of man
for still further generations. The same elements
which in geologic time fashioned the caves and
recesses of the cañon walls, have in later times
worn the approaches away, so that to-day they
do not even furnish a footing for the bear or
coyote. In what remote age and for how many
generations the cliff-dwellers lived in these strange
fastnesses, will probably never be determined.
Faint traces of still older buildings are found
here and there in the bed of Cañon de Chelly;
and it is conjectured that this region was once
densely populated along the watercourses, and
that the tribes having been driven from their
homes by a powerful foe, the remnant sought
refuge in the caves of the cañon walls.</p>

<p>Of the great antiquity of these structures, there
is no question. The Indian of to-day knows
nothing of their history, has not even traditions
concerning them. The Navajo, with a few poles
plastered with a heavy deposit of earth, constructs
his <i>hogan</i> or wigwam, and rarely remains in the
same place winter and summer. He has no more
idea of constructing a dwelling like those so perfectly
preserved in the cliffs, than he has of baking
specimens of pottery such as are found in fragments
amongst the walls. In the fine quality of
paste, in the animal handles—something like old
Japanese ware—and in the general ornamentation,
these exhibit a high order of excellence. Some
specimens of what is called laminated ware are
remarkable; threadlike layers of clay are laid
one on each other with admirable delicacy and
patience. In these fragments may yet be read
something of the history of a vanished race.
They illuminate a dark corner in the world’s
history, and seem to indicate a people who once
felt civilising influences higher than anything
known by those uncouth figures whose camp-fires
now glimmer at night across the silent
starlit prairie.</p>

<p class="ph3">A STORY IN EIGHT CHAPTERS.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Bowood</span> came forward. ‘Sir Frederick,
your servant; glad to see you,’ he said in his
hearty sailor-like fashion.</p>

<p>‘I am glad to see you, Captain,’ responded the
Baronet as he proffered his hand. ‘How’s the
gout this morning?’</p>

<p>‘So, so. Might be better—might be worse.—You
here, Miss Saucebox!’ he added, turning
to Elsie. ‘Why are you not at your lessons—eh,
now?’</p>

<p>‘As if anybody could learn Latin roots on a
sunny morning like this!’ Then, clasping one of
his arms with both her hands, and looking up
coaxingly into his face, she said: ‘You might
give me a holiday, nunky dear.’</p>

<p>‘Why, why? A holiday indeed!—Listen to
her, Sir Frederick. The baggage is always
begging for holidays.’</p>

<p>‘But the baggage doesn’t always get them,’
was the answer with a pretty pout. Then, after
another glance at the long-haired stranger, who
was already busy with the piano, she said to
herself: ‘It is he; I am sure of it. And yet
if I had not heard his voice, I should not have
known him.’</p>

<p>Captain Bowood at this time had left his
sixtieth birthday behind him, but he carried his
years lightly. He was a bluff, hearty-looking,
loud-voiced man, with a very red face, and very
white hair and whiskers. A fever, several years
previously, had radically impaired his eyesight,
since which time he had taken to wearing gold-rimmed
spectacles. He had a choleric temper;
but his bursts of petulance were like those
summer storms which are over almost as soon
as they have broken, and leave not a cloud behind.
Throughout the American Civil War, Captain
Bowood had been known as one of the most daring
and successful blockade-runners, and it was during
those days of danger and excitement that he laid
the foundation of the fortune on which he had
since retired. No man was more completely ruled
by his wife than the choleric but generous-hearted
Captain, and no man suspected the fact less than
he did.</p>

<p>‘I drove over this morning,’ said Sir Frederick,
‘to see you about that bay mare which I hear
you are desirous of getting rid of.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes—just so. We’ll go to the stable
and have a look at her. By-the-bye, I was talking
to Boyd just now, when your name cropped
up. It seems he met you when you were both
in South America. Oscar Boyd, engineering
fellow and all that. You remember him, eh,
now?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>{42}</span></p>

<p>‘I certainly do remember a Mr Boyd; but it
is many years since we met.’ Then to himself
the Baronet said: ‘Can this be the other man?
Oh! Lady Dimsdale.’</p>

<p>‘A very agreeable fellow,’ said the Captain.
‘Here on a visit for a couple of days. A little
matter of business between him and me to save
lawyers’ expenses.’</p>

<p>‘The other man, without a doubt,’ thought the
Baronet. ‘His wife must be dead.’</p>

<p>Miss Brandon had slipped unobserved out of
the room. She was now sitting in the veranda,
making-believe to be intent over her Latin verbs,
but in reality waiting impatiently till the coast
should be clear. She had not long to wait.
Presently she heard the Captain say in his cheery
loud-voiced way: ‘Come along, Sir Frederick;
we shall just have time to look at the mare before
luncheon;’ and a minute later, she heard the
shutting of a door.</p>

<p>Then she shut her book, rose from her seat,
and crossing on tiptoe to the open French-window,
she peeped into the room. ‘Is that
you, Charley?’ she asked in a voice that was
little above a whisper.</p>

<p>‘Whom else should it be?’ answered the
young man, looking round from the piano with
a smile.</p>

<p>‘I was nearly sure of it from the first; but
then you look such a guy!’</p>

<p>‘She calls me a guy! after all the trouble I
have taken to get myself up like a foreign
nobleman.’ Speaking thus, he took off his
spectacles and wig, and stood revealed, as
pleasant-looking a young fellow as one would
see in a day’s march.</p>

<p>Elsie ran forward with a little cry of surprise
and delight. ‘Now I know you for my own!’
she exclaimed; and when he took her in his
arms and kissed her—more than once—she offered
not the slightest resistance. ‘But what a dreadful
risk to run!’ she went on as soon as she
was set at liberty. ‘Suppose your uncle—good
gracious!’</p>

<p>‘My uncle? He can’t eat me, that’s certain;
and he has already cut me off with the proverbial
shilling.’</p>

<p>‘My poor boy! Fate is very, very hard upon
you. We are both down on our luck, Charley;
but we can die together, can’t we?’ As she
propounded this question, she held out her box
of bon-bons. Charley took one, she took another,
and then the box was put away. ‘A pan of
charcoal’—she went on, giving her sweetmeat
a gustatory turn over with her tongue—‘door
and windows close shut—you go to sleep and
forget to wake up. What could be simpler?’</p>

<p>‘Hardly anything. But we have not quite
come to that yet. Of course, that dreadful Vice-chancellor
won’t let me marry you for some time
to come; but he can’t help himself when you are
one-and-twenty.’</p>

<p>‘That won’t be for nearly four years,’ answered
Elsie with a pout. ‘What a long, long time to
look forward to!’</p>

<p>‘We have only to be true to each other, which
I am sure we shall be, and it will pass away far
more quickly than you imagine. By that time,
I hope to be earning enough money to find you
a comfortable home.’</p>

<p>‘There’s my money, you know, Charley dear.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t mean to have anything to do with that.
If I can’t earn enough to keep my wife, I’ll never
marry.’</p>

<p>‘Oh!’</p>

<p>‘But I shall do that, dear. Why, I’m getting
five guineas a week already; and if I’m not
getting three times as much as that by the time
you are twenty-one, I’ll swallow my wig.’</p>

<p>‘Your uncle will never forgive you for going
on the stage.’</p>

<p>‘O yes, he will, by-and-by, when he sees
that I am making a fair living by it and
really mean to stick to it—having sown all my
wild-oats; and above all, when he finds how well
they speak of me in his favourite newspaper.
And that reminds me that it was what the
<i>Telephone</i> said about me that caused old Brooker
our manager to raise my screw from four guineas
a week to five. I cut the notice out of the paper,
you may be sure. Here it is.’ Speaking thus,
Master Charles produced his pocket-book; and
drew from it a printed slip of paper, which he
proceeded to read aloud: ‘“Although we have
had occasion more than once to commend the
acting of Mr Warden”—that’s me—“we were
certainly surprised last evening by his very
masterly rendering of the part of Captain Cleveland.
His byplay was remarkably clever; and
his impassioned love-making in the third act,
where timidity or hesitation would have been
fatal to the piece, brought down the house, and
earned him two well-merited recalls. We certainly
consider that there is no more promising
<i>jeune premier</i> than Mr Warden now on the stage.”
There, my pet, what do you think of that?’ asked
the young actor as he put back the slip of paper
into his pocket-book.</p>

<p>But his pet vouchsafed no answer. Her face
was turned from him; a tear fell from her eye.
His arms were round her in a moment. ‘My
darling child, what can be the matter?’ he
asked.</p>

<p>‘I—I wish you had never gone on the stage,’
said Elsie, with a sob in her voice. ‘I—I wish
you were still a tea-broker!’</p>

<p>‘Good gracious! what makes you wish anything
so absurd?’</p>

<p>‘It’s not absurd. Doesn’t the newspaper speak
of your “impassioned love-making?” And then
people—lovers, I mean—are always kissing each
other on the stage.’</p>

<p>‘Just as they do sometimes in real life;’ and
with that he suited the action to the word.</p>

<p>‘Don’t, Mr Summers, please.’ And she pushed
him away, and her eyes flashed through her
tears, and she looked very pretty.</p>

<p>Mr Summers sat down on a chair and was
unfeeling enough to laugh. ‘Why, what a little
goose you are!’ he said.</p>

<p>‘I don’t see it at all.’ This with a toss of her
head. Certainly, it is not pleasant to be called
a goose.</p>

<p>‘You must know, if you come to think of it,
that both love-making and kissing on the stage
are only so much make-believe, however real
they may seem to the audience. During the
last six months, it has been my fate to have
to make love to about a dozen different ladies;
and during the next six months I shall probably
have to do the same thing to as many more;
but to imagine on that account that I really<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>{43}</span>
care for any of them, or that they really care
for me, would be as absurd as to suppose that
because in the piece we shall play to-morrow
night I shall hunt Tom Bowles—who is the
villain of the drama—through three long acts,
and kill him in the fourth, he and I must
necessarily hate each other. The fact is that
Tom and I are the best of friends, and generally
contrive to lodge together when on our travels.’</p>

<p>Elsie was half convinced that she <i>had</i> made a
goose of herself, but of course was not prepared
to admit it. ‘I see that Miss Wylie is acting in
your company,’ she said. ‘I saw her in London
about a year ago; she is very, very pretty.’</p>

<p>‘Miss Wylie is a very charming woman.’</p>

<p>‘And you make love to her?’</p>

<p>‘Every night of my life—for a little while.’</p>

<p>Elsie felt her unreasonable mood coming back.
‘Then why don’t you marry her?’ she asked
with a ring of bitterness in her voice.</p>

<p>Again that callous-hearted young man laughed.
‘Considering that she is married already, and the
happy mother of two children, I can hardly see
the feasibility of your suggestion.’</p>

<p>‘Then why does she call herself “Miss
Wylie?”’</p>

<p>‘It’s a way they have in the profession. She
goes by her maiden name. In reality, she is
Mrs Berrington. Her husband travels with her.
He plays “heavy fathers.”’</p>

<p>Miss Brandon looked mystified. Her lover
saw it.</p>

<p>‘You see this suit of clothes,’ he said, ‘and this
wig and these spectacles. They are part of the
“make-up” of a certain character I played last
week. I was the Count von Rosenthal, in love
with the beautiful daughter of a poor music-master.
In order to be able to make love to
her, and win her for myself, and not for my
title and riches, I go in the guise of a student,
and take lodgings in the same house where she
and her father are living. After many mishaps,
all ends as it ought to do. Charlotte and I fall
into each other’s arms, and her father blesses
us both with tears in his eyes. Miss Wylie played
the Professor’s daughter, and her husband played
the father’s part, and very well he did it too.’</p>

<p>‘Her husband allowed you to make love to
his wife?’ said Miss Brandon, with wide-open
eyes.</p>

<p>‘Of course he did; and he was not so foolish
as to be jealous, like some people. Why should
he be?’</p>

<p>Elsie was fully convinced by this time that
she had made a goose of herself. ‘You may kiss
me, Charley,’ she said with much sweetness.
‘Dear boy, I forgive you.’</p>

<p>Suddenly the sound of a footstep caused
them to start and fly asunder. There, close to
the open French-window, stood Captain Bowood,
glaring from one to the other of them. Miss
Brandon gave vent to a little shriek and fled from
the room. The Captain came forward, a fine frenzy
in his eye. ‘Who the deuce may you be, sir?’
he spluttered, although he had recognised Charley
at the first glance.</p>

<p>‘I have the honour to be your very affectionate
and obedient nephew, sir.’</p>

<p>The Captain’s reply to this was an inarticulate
growl. Next moment, his eye fell on the discarded
wig. ‘And what the dickens may this be, sir?’
he asked as he lifted up the article in question
on the end of his cane.</p>

<p>‘A trifle of property, sir, belonging to your
affectionate and obedient nephew;’ and with that
he took the wig off the end of the cane and
crammed it into his pocket.</p>

<p>‘So, so. This is the way, you young jackanapes,
that you set my commands at defiance, and steal
into my house after being forbidden ever to set
foot in it again! You young snake-in-the-grass!
You crocodile! It would serve you right to give
you in charge to the police. How do I know
that you are not after my spoons and forks?
Come now.’</p>

<p>‘I am glad to find, sir, that your powers of
vituperation are in no way impaired since I had
the pleasure of seeing you last. Time cannot
wither them.—Hem! I believe, sir, that you have
had the honour of twice paying my debts, amounting
in the aggregate to the trifling sum of five
hundred pounds. In this paper, sir, you will
find twenty-five sovereigns, being my first dividend
of one shilling in the pound. A further dividend
will be paid at the earliest possible date.’ As Mr
Summers spoke thus, he drew from his waistcoat
pocket a small sealed packet and placed the same
quietly on the table.</p>

<p>The irate Captain glanced at the packet and
then at his imperturbable nephew. The cane
trembled in his fingers; for a moment or two
he could not command his voice. ‘What, what!’
he cried at last. ‘The boy will drive me crazy.
What does he mean with his confounded rigmarole?
Dividend! Shilling in the pound! Bother
me, if I can make head or tail of his foolery!’</p>

<p>‘And yet, sir, both my words and my meaning
were clear enough, as no doubt you will find
when you come to think them over in your
calmer moments.—And now I have the honour
to wish you a very good-morning; and I hope to
afford you the pleasure of seeing me again before
long.’ Speaking thus, Charles Summers made
his uncle a very low bow, took up his hat, and
walked out of the room.</p>

<p>‘There’s insolence! There’s audacity!’ burst
out the Captain as soon as he found himself alone.
‘The pleasure of seeing him again—eh? Only
let me find him here without my leave—I’ll—I’ll——
I don’t know what I won’t do!—And
now I come to think of it, it looks very much
as if he and Miss Saucebox were making love
to each other. How dare they? I’ll haul ’em
both up before the Vice-chancellor.’ Here his
eye fell on the packet on the table. He took it
up and examined it. ‘Twenty-five sovereigns,
did he say? As if I was going to take the young
idiot’s money! I’ll keep it for the present, and
send it back to him by-and-by. Must teach him
a lesson. Do him all the good in the world.
False hair and spectacles, eh? Deceived his old
uncle finely. Just the sort of trick I should have
delighted in when I was a boy. But Master
Charley will be clever if he catches the old fox
asleep a second time.’ He had reached the French-window
on his way out, when he came to a sudden
stand, and gave vent to a low whistle. ‘Ha, ha!
Lady Dimsdale and Mr Boyd, and mighty taken
up with each other they seem. Well, well. I’m
no spoil-sport. I’ll not let them know I’ve seen
them. Looks uncommonly as if Dan Cupid had
got them by the ears. A widow too! All widows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>{44}</span>
ought to be labelled “Dangerous.”’ Smiling and
chuckling to himself, the Captain drew back,
crossed the room, and went out by the opposite
door.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_COLOUR-SENSE">THE COLOUR-SENSE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> phenomenon of Colour is one with which all
who are not blind must of necessity be familiar.
So accustomed, indeed, have we been to it
throughout all our lives, that most of us are
inclined to take it for granted, and probably
trouble ourselves very seldom as to its true cause.
A brief discussion, therefore, of the nature of the
Colour-sense may, we trust, prove not uninteresting
to our readers.</p>

<p>What, then, is colour? It is obvious that it
may be considered in two ways; we may either
discuss the impression it makes on the mind, or
the real external causes to which it is due.
Viewed in the first light, colour is as much a
sensation as is that of being struck or burnt.
Viewed from the latter stand-point, it is merely
a property of light; hence, in order correctly
to understand its nature, we must first briefly
examine the nature of this phenomenon.</p>

<p>According to modern scientific men, light is
not a material substance, but consists of a kind
of motion or vibration communicated by the
luminous body to the surrounding medium, and
travelling throughout space with an enormous
velocity. The medium, however, through which
light-waves travel is not air, nor any of the
ordinary forms of matter. Of its real nature
nothing is known, and its very existence is only
assumed in order to account for the observed
phenomena. It must be very subtle and very
elastic; but it is a curious fact that the nature
of the vibrations in question would seem to
preclude the supposition that it is a fluid, these
being rather such as would be met with in the
case of a solid. To this medium, whatever its
true nature may be, the name of <i>ether</i> is given.</p>

<p>The sensation, then, which we know by the
name of Light is to be regarded as the effect on
the retina of the eye of certain very rapid vibrations
in the <i>ether</i> of the universe. All these
waves travel with the same swiftness; but they
are not all of the same length, nor of the same
frequency; and investigation has shown that it
is to this difference of wave-length that difference
of colour is due. In other words, the impression
to which we give the name of a certain colour is
due to the effect on the retina of vibrations of a
certain frequency. This conclusion is arrived at
by a very simple experiment, in which advantage
is taken of the following principle. So long as a
ray of light is passing through the same medium,
it travels in one straight line; but in passing
obliquely from one medium into another of
different density, its path is bent through a certain
angle, just as a column of soldiers has a tendency
to change its direction of march when obliquely
entering a wood or other difficult ground. Now,
this angle is naturally greatest in the case of
the shortest waves, so that when a ray of light
is thus bent out of its course—or, as it is called,
‘refracted’—the various sets of vibrations of
which it is composed all travel in different
directions, and may be separately examined. In
fact the ray of light is analysed, or broken up
into its component parts. The most convenient
apparatus to employ for this purpose is a prism
of glass. It is found, as is well known, that if a
beam of ordinary sun-light be allowed to pass
through the prism and be then received on a
screen, it is resolved into a band of colours
succeeding one another in the order of those of
the rainbow. Such a band of colours is called a
‘spectrum.’</p>

<p>Now, of the visible portion of the spectrum
the red rays are those which undergo the least
refraction, while the violet rays are bent through
the greatest angle, the other colours in their
natural order being intermediate. From what
has been said above, it is evident that, this being
the case, the portion of the light consisting of
waves of greatest length and least frequency is
that which produces on the eye the sensation of
red, and that each of the other colours is caused
by vibrations of a certain definite length. We are
speaking now of the visible part of the spectrum.
As a matter of fact, the waves of least and greatest
frequency make no impression on the eye at all;
but the former have the greatest heating power,
while the latter are those which chiefly produce
chemical effects such as are utilised in photography.</p>

<p>Having now arrived at the nature of colour,
we are in a position to apply these facts to the
discussion of coloured substances.</p>

<p>When light falls on a body, a portion of it is
turned back or, as it is called, ‘reflected’ from
the surface; another part is taken up or ‘absorbed’
by the substance; while, in the case of a transparent
body, a third portion passes on through it,
and is said to be ‘transmitted.’ Most bodies
absorb the different parts of the light in different
proportions, and hence their various colours are
produced. The colour of a transparent substance
is that of the light which it transmits; while an
opaque body is said to be of the colour of the
light which it reflects, or rather of that part of
it which is irregularly scattered.</p>

<p>There are three colours in the solar spectrum
which are called ‘primary,’ owing to the fact that
they cannot be produced by mixtures. These are
red, violet, and deep olive green. The generally-received
idea that red, blue, and yellow are primary
colours, is by recent scientific authorities not
regarded as tenable; it arose from observations on
mixtures of pigments rather than of coloured light.
For instance, objects seen through two plates of
glass, one of which is blue and the other yellow,
appear green; but this by no means justifies
us in saying that a mixture of blue and yellow
light is green. For remembering that the two
glasses do not appear coloured by reason of their
adding anything to the light, but rather through
their stopping the passage of certain rays, we
shall see that the green light which is finally
transmitted is not a mixture of yellow and blue
at all, but is rather that portion of the light which
both of the glasses allow to pass. The blue glass
will probably stop all rays except blue, violet,
and green; the yellow glass, all but green, yellow,
and orange. The only light, therefore, which
can pass through both glasses is green. The same
remark applies to mixtures of pigments, each
particle being really transparent, though the
whole bulk appears opaque. It is easy, however,
to obtain real mixtures of coloured lights by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>{45}</span>
employing suitable arrangements, of which one
of the simplest consists of a disc painted with
alternate bands of colours and rapidly rotated.
By such means it is found that a mixture of blue
and yellow is not green, but white or gray, and
that yellow can itself be produced by a mixture
of red and green in proper proportions. The late
Professor Clerk Maxwell made an interesting
series of experiments on colour mixtures by
means of an apparatus known as Maxwell’s
Colour-box, by which any number of colours could
be combined in any required proportions.</p>

<p>It would, however, be beyond the scope of the
present paper to discuss the many important
results which followed from his investigations.
Helmholtz believed the three primary colour
sensations to be clue to the action of three sets
of nerves at the back of the retina, each of which
is excited only by vibrations within a certain
range of frequency; and this theory is now generally
held. In the case of some persons, the
sensation corresponding to red is wholly absent,
and the spectrum appears to consist of two colours
with white or gray between. The nature of
these colours is, for obvious reasons, difficult to
determine; but one doubtless nearly corresponds
to our sensation of blue, while the other is a
deep colour, probably dark green. Persons thus
affected are usually called ‘colour-blind;’ but
this epithet is a misnomer, and the term ‘dichroic
vision’ has been suggested for the phenomenon
instead.</p>

<p>We have already remarked that our range of
vision is comparatively narrow, the extreme portions
of the spectrum making no impression on the
retina. But we have no reason to think that these
limits have been the same in all ages. The evidence
would rather tend to show that the human
eye is undergoing a slow and gradual development,
which enables it to distinguish between colours
which the ancients regarded as identical, and may
in future render it able to perceive some portions
at least of the parts of the spectrum which
are now invisible. The Vedas of India, which
are among the most ancient writings known,
attest that in the most remote ages only white
and black could be distinguished.</p>

<p>It would seem as if the perception of different
degrees of intensity of light preceded by a long
time the appreciation of various kinds of colours.
After weighing the evidence, Magnus has come
to the conclusion that red was the first colour
to become visible, then yellow and orange; and
afterwards, though at a considerable interval,
green, blue, and violet in order. Various passages
in the Old Testament have been cited as proof
that the ancients failed to perceive all the colours
seen by us, one of the most remarkable being in
Ezekiel i. 27 and 28, where the prophet compares
the appearance of the brightness round about the
fire to that of the ‘bow that is in the cloud in
the day of rain’—which passage has been cited
by Mr Gladstone in his article in the <i>Nineteenth
Century</i> for October 1877, as indicating a want of
appreciation of distinct colours among the ancients.
This is not quite clear, however, as the appearance
round about the supernatural fire might have
assumed auroral or rainbow tints. But the most
important evidence on the apparent want of
capacity among the ancients to discriminate
between colours is that afforded by the writings
of Homer, who, in the opinion of Magnus,
could neither have perceived green nor blue.
The point has been carefully examined by Mr
Gladstone, who comes to the conclusion that this
estimate is quite within the mark. Inquiring in
detail into each of Homer’s colour-epithets, he
shows that almost all must be in reality regarded
as expressing degrees of intensity rather than of
quality, and that the few exceptions are all confined
to red and yellow. The brilliant blue sky
of the southern climes where Homer lived must
have appeared to him as of a neutral gray hue.
Of course, the suggestion that the writings
usually assigned to Homer were in reality the
productions of many authors, does not invalidate
the reasoning at all, as we do not attribute
any defect in vision to the poet which was not
equally manifested by his contemporaries.</p>

<p>It is curious that the distinction between green
and blue is not yet perfectly developed in all
nations. Travellers tell us that the Burmese often
confuse these colours in a remarkable manner.
This and other facts suggest that the development
of the colour-sense is not yet completed; and
that in the future our range of perception may
be still further enlarged, so that the now invisible
rays may be recognised by the eye as distinct
colours.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">A SKETCH FROM LIFE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> long before the death of George Eliot, on
a return trip to London by the Midland route,
I broke my journey at Leicester, to pay a
flying visit to Coventry, where the great writer
had spent many of her happiest days. There
I was privileged by having for escort one of
her most valued friends; and many interesting
reminiscences were for our benefit called to mind,
especially of a visit paid to Edinburgh, ‘mine own
romantic town,’ and of the impression the beauty
of its situation had made on her mind. Next
morning, every favourite haunt of hers was searched
out and commented on, as well as the interesting
points of the quaint old city of Coventry; and
bidding good-bye to our hospitable friends, I
departed alone by the evening mail for Leicester,
there to wait for the midnight train to Edinburgh,
feeling satisfied that the hours had been well
spent. Arrived in Leicester, I was fortunate in
finding a fellow-countryman in one of the porters,
who at once took me and my belongings under
his especial protection, and when he had seen
me comfortably ‘happit up’ on one of the sofas
of the luxurious waiting-room, he retired, bidding
me take a quiet forty winks, and keep my mind
quite easy, for he would give me timely notice of
the arrival of the Scotch train. Scarcely had I
begun to feel the loneliness of my situation, when
the door opened, and a female figure entered,
rather unwilling, apparently; nay, seemed to
be pushed in, while a deep male voice advised
that she should rest by the fire, and not put
herself about so. By a succession of jerks, she
advanced to the chair by the fire opposite to my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>{46}</span>
sofa; and finding that I was not asleep, as she
had supposed, at once, and without any circumlocution,
began to unburden her mind, her words
flowing from her mouth at express speed, regardless
of comma or full stop.</p>

<p>‘Not put myself about! Humph! That’s so
like men.—Ain’t it now, miss? Ah, I dessay
you’ve ’ad your own share of worriting before
now, and know ’ow downright masterful and
provoking they can be at times. I tell you <i>w’at</i>,
miss, if you want to be at peace at all, you’ve
got to say black is w’ite, if they ’ave a mind that
it should be so.—Not put myself about! I’d like
to know ’ow one with a ’eart and a soul in their
body could ’elp being put about, as I am.’</p>

<p>I ventured to hope nothing serious had occurred
to disturb her composure or to put her about,
my voice at once disclosing that I hailed from
the North, and also that I was of a sympathetic
nature.</p>

<p>‘Put about!’ she once more exclaimed. ‘Why,
I <i>am</i> put about; yes—no use trying to appear
as if I was anything else. Yes; only think, miss!
Not ’alf an hour gone, a telegram was brought to
our ’ouse by the telegraph-boy. His mother, a
widow, keeps a little bit of a shop not many doors
from our own. Yes; he ’ands it in saying it
was for father. I opened it; and there, staring
me right in the eyes were them words: “<i>Step-mother
is lying a-dying.</i>”—Not put about! I’d
just like to know ’ow anybody could ’ave
been anything else than put about, after <i>that</i>.
Now, miss, you must understand that John—that’s
my ’usband—is a great go-to-meeting-man.
Why, at that very moment he might be at the
church meeting, or he might ’ave been at the
Building meeting, or he might ’ave been at
a Masonic meeting, or he might ’ave been
at any other meeting under the sun. And w’atever
was I to do? for there was the telegraph-boy;
there was the telegram, with the words as plain
as plain: “Step-mother is lying a-dying.” I
put on my bonnet and shawl; I ’urried to father’s
office—he is a master-builder, is father, with sixteen
men under him and three apprentices; and
John, my son, for partner. I rushed in quite out
of breath, not expecting to find any one there
at that time of night; but there I found John—that’s
my son—and says I, without taking time
to sit down, though I was like to drop: “John,
w’atever is to be done! Here’s a telegraph-boy
has brought a telegram for father to say, step-mother
is a-dying.’”</p>

<p>‘Now, miss, I just put it to you, if them telegrams,
coming so sudden at hours w’en no one
expects postmen’s knocks, and bringing such news
as that, ain’t enough to put any one about! Augh!
Men are so queer; there’s no nerves in their bodies,
and can’t understand us women. I’ve no patience
with them. There was John—that’s my son—w’at
did he do? Why, look at me quite composed,
as if it weren’t no news at all, and says he:
“Don’t put yourself about, mother. Father has
gone off not many minutes ago to the paddock,
to give little Bobbie a ride.” And with that he
takes down a time-table, to look at it for the
last train, puts on his hat, calls for a cab, and says
quite composed: “Jump in, mother. We’ll go
in pursuit of father, and then we’ll catch the train
quite easily.” It seemed to me the horse just
crept up the ’ill like a snail; only John would
’ave it they were going faster than their usual
pace. W’en we came to our door, w’at do you
think we saw, now, miss?—No; you’ll never
guess, I dessay. Why, <i>father</i>, to be sure! Yes;
there he was; and there was the pony; and there
was little Bobbie—all three of ’em just about
to start for a long ride into the country. I ’ad
carried the telegram in my pocket; and do you
know, miss, after all my flurry and worry, w’at
did John—that’s my ’usband—say, think you?—Augh!
Men are so unreasonable, and w’at’s
more, such cool and ’eartless pieces. Yes; that’s
w’at <i>they</i> are; and I don’t care who hears me
a-saying it.</p>

<p>‘John—that’s father—after he had read the
telegram, he turns to me, and says he: “Why,
mother, ’ave your senses left your ’ead altogether?
W’atever made you carry off the telegram!
Couldn’t you ’ave stayed quietly at ’ome, instead
of putting yourself about in this here fashion?
If you ’ad, we’d ’ave been at the station without
any hurry at all, by this time.”</p>

<p>‘I felt too angry to speak, I do declare, miss.
I think the older men grow, the more aggravating
they get to a sensitive nature. So I gathered
the things together father said we’d better take
with us, into my travelling-basket, without as
much as a single word—a stranger coming in
would ’ave thought me dumb—while father sent
a man back to the paddock with little Bobbie and
the pony. We then got into the cab once more;
and here we are, with John—that’s my son—a-looking
after the tickets and the luggage; and
father smoking his pipe outside as cool as cool.
O dear, if they wouldn’t put me out with their
“Keep cool, mother; no need to fluster and flurry
so, mother”—“Take it easy, good ooman; don’t
put yourself about”—I’d bear it better, I certainly
should.</p>

<p>‘Is step-mother nice? you ask. Oh—well—that’s
just as you take it. Some people say
she’s nice; some say she’s quite the opposite.
But’—and here she drew her chair closer to me,
and in a more confidential tone, continued: ‘I
tell you <i>w’at</i>, miss—I’ve said it before, and I say
it again—step-mother, in spite of her religious
pro-fession and san’timonious ways, is cantankerous.
No use a-trying to hide it—step-mother
is just w’at I say, <i>can-tankerous</i>. I’ve said it
before; I say it again—she’d show her cantankerousness
to the very last. And han’t
my words come true, for here she is lying
a-dying, and Mary-Anne’s wedding fixed for
Friday of this very week!—O my—now that I
come to ’ave a quiet moment to think, w’atever
am I to do? It’s so unreasonable of step-mother!
Why, the dressmaker was coming this very
evening to fit my dress on for the second time—a
new black silk it is—and w’atever will <i>she</i>
think, w’en she finds I’ve gone off without as
much as a good-bye message? You see, miss,
Mary-Anne is going to marry into quite a genteel
family. Father, and John—that’s my son—he
comes to me not many weeks gone, and says he:
“Mother, I ’ope you are going to ’ave a nice dress
for this wedding. I ’ope it will be a silk or
a satin you decide to buy.” And says I: “John,
you know w’at father is, and ’as been all his
life—a just man to all; but a man who looks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>{47}</span>
upon gay clothes as not necessary. And then,
John, you know as well as I do that father is
rather close-fisted w’en money has to be paid out—like
his own father before him, who was looked
upon by all as the most parsimonious man in
the town. I don’t say father is quite as bad;
but close-fisted I <i>do</i> say he is, John; and you
know it. Were I to say: ‘Father, I’d like to
’ave a silk dress for this wedding’—and I don’t
hide the fact from <i>you</i>, John, that I certainly
should—he’d just laugh. I know it beforehand.
He’d say: ‘Why, mother, ’aven’t you been
content with a good stuff-dress all our married
life, and can’t you go on to the end so? I’ve
over and over again said my wife looked as well
as most women in the town of Leicester.’”</p>

<p>‘“But,” says John—that’s my son—“mother,
you owe your duty certainly to father. I’m not
going against it; but w’at I says is: You owe
your duty to your son also; and w’en I wish <i>my</i>
mother to look better than she’s ever done before,
why—to oblige me—you’ll go and purchase the
best silk-dress in town, ’ave it made fashionable,
with frills and all the fal-de-rals and etceteras;
send in the account in my name; and if father
makes any objections, why, let him settle the
matter with <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>‘You see, miss, John is getting to be so like
father—both <i>firm</i>, very; and if they take a
notion of any kind w’atever into their ’eads,
you’d move this station as soon as move them
from their purpose; so the dress ’as been bought;
and w’at father will say to it—for it’s to be made
in the height of the fashion—<i>I</i> can’t say.’</p>

<p>A few judicious questions about the step-mother
who was lying a-dying, drew from my
companion that the said old lady was rich as well
as cantankerous; and that, as there were other
relations who might step in to the injury of the
worthy builder, who was her only stepson, it was,
to say the least, but prudent to be on the
spot.</p>

<p>‘Ah, yes, miss,’ she exclaimed, stretching her
hands out to keep the heat of the fire from her
face, ‘this is a very strange world. Only on
Sunday, the vicar was preaching to us against
worldly-mindedness, telling us that as we came
naked into the world, so we left it, carrying
nothing away. But, miss, step-mother ain’t like
the most of people; and she’s going to manage
to take with her as much money as she possibly
can.—How is she going to do it? Why, miss—she’s
going to ’ave a coffin!—No need to look
surprised, miss. O yes; we all bury our dead
in coffins; but w’at kind of a coffin is step-mother
going to ’ave, do you think? No; don’t
try to guess, for you’d be down to Scotland and
up again before it would ever come into your
’ead.—No; not a velvet one, nor a satin; but a
<i>hoak</i> one.—Yes; I thought you would get a scare.
A <i>hoak</i> coffin is w’at it is to be. And she’s going
to ’ave bearers—six of ’em. Each bearer is to
’ave ’at-bands and scarfs, and two pounds apiece.
And if all that pomp and tomfoolery ain’t taking
so much money out of the world with her, I
don’t know w’at <i>is</i>. W’en John—that’s father—heard
of it, says he to me: “Mother, if you
survives me, bury me plain, but comf’able;” and
says I: “Father, if you survives me, I ’ope you
will do the same by me—plain, but comf’able;
for I tell you w’at, father, I’d not lie easy underground
thinking of the waste of good money over
such ’umbug.”’</p>

<p>Here the waiting-room door opened hurriedly,
and the worthy woman bounded to her feet at
the one word ‘Mother!’ pronounced in such a
decided tone that I too was standing beside her
before I knew what I was doing, with all my
wraps tossed higgledy-piggledy on the floor.
Advancing with her to the door, she got out of
me that my immediate destination was Scotland—a
place, to her mind, evidently as remote as the
arctic regions; and in her astonishment, she forgot
the necessity there was to hurry to get in to her
train, now ready to start again. She even seemed
to forget that step-mother was lying a-dying, as
she insisted upon introducing me to her husband,
whose huge body was wrapped in a greatcoat,
with tippet after tippet on it up to his neck.
‘Only to think, John—this lady is going to
Scotland all alone, John! She’ll be travelling
all night.—O dear, however are you to do it,
miss; ain’t you afraid?—Yes, John; I’m coming.—Good-bye,
miss; we’ve ’ad quite a pleasant
chat, I do assure you; the time seems to ’ave
flown.’</p>

<p>I hurried her along the platform, whispering to
her as I did so: ‘I hope step-mother will rally a
bit; that if she must pass away, it may be next
week, so that Mary-Anne may get her wedding
comfortably over.’ At the very door of the carriage
she paused, seized my hand, shook it warmly,
as she exclaimed: ‘Well, now, you ’ave a feeling
’eart; but I don’t expect her to be so accommodating.
No; I’ve said it before, and I say it again—step-mother
is—<i>can-ta</i>—— Why, w’atever is
the matter?’</p>

<p>Next thing that happened, the little woman
was lifted up bodily in her son’s arms—a counterpart
of his father—and deposited in the carriage;
while her husband, in spite of his lumbering
large body, succeeded in jumping in just as
the patience of all the railway officials was
exhausted, and the signal given to start the
train. Before it was lost to view, a white
handkerchief fluttered out, by way of good-bye,
causing a smile to rise over the calm features
of John the younger, who, lifting his hat politely
to me, bade me good-evening, adding: ‘Mother
is no great traveller, so she is easily put about.
Dessay if she went often from ’ome, she’d learn
to be more composed.’</p>

<p>From that hour I have never ceased to regret
that I did not ask the good-natured young builder
to forward me a local paper with the account of
the death and burial of ‘step-mother.’ No doubt
there would be due notice taken of such an
interesting personage, as she lay in state in her
‘hoak’ coffin, surrounded by her bearers in the
flowing scarfs and hat-bands. Sharp as my
friends generally give me credit for being, I own
I committed a grievous blunder; I am therefore
obliged to leave my story without an end, not
being able even to add that the fair Mary-Anne’s
wedding came off on the appointed day, or was
postponed till after the complimentary days of
mourning were past. I cheer myself with the
thought that ‘John—that’s father’—being a firm
man and a sensible, would insist upon the previous
arrangements standing good, seeing that the bridegroom—a
most important fact I have omitted
to record—had a fortnight’s holiday reluctantly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>{48}</span>
granted to him by his employers. Why, now
that I think of it, my countryman the railway
porter would have sent me any number of papers,
judging by the kindly interest he took in my
behalf, and the determined manner he fought
for a particular seat for me in a particular
carriage when the time came for my train to
start. ‘Na, na, mem; nae need for thanks;
blood’s thicker than water,’ he said. ‘Never
you fear, now that the Scotch guard has ta’en up
your cause; you’re a’ right; he’ll see that ye’re
safely housed.’ And safely housed I was, and
went steaming out of the station with my worthy
friend hanging on by the door, calling to me:
‘If you’re ever in the town o’ Perth, mem, my
auld mother would be downright pleased to see
you, for my sake. Tell her I’m getting on as
weel as can be expeckit, sae far frae hame.’</p>

<p>All night, my disturbed sleep was made doubly
so by dreams of old women of every age and style.
Now I was hunting for the porter’s nameless
mother; now I was standing by the bedside of the
step-mother who was lying a-dying. Again I was
an active assistant at a marriage ceremony, with the
fair Mary-Anne, surrounded by her genteel relations,
leaning on my shoulder, weeping copiously
at the idea of travelling to Scotland. Once more
I stood gazing down on the old step-mother; and
just as the day dawned, I was fairly roused, in
my determination not to be smothered under an
oak coffin and a pyramid of scarfs, hat-bands, and
bearers, by the tumbling of my own bonnet-box
from the luggage-rack above me.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="FRENCH_DETECTIVES">FRENCH DETECTIVES.</h2>
</div>


<p>‘The Secret Police’ in France are not only
personally unknown to the general public, but,
save in exceptional cases, even to each other.
It is known where they may be found at a
moment’s notice when wanted; but, as a rule,
they do not frequent the prefecture more than
can be helped. They have nothing whatever
to do with serving summonses or executing
warrants. There are among them men who have
lived in almost every class of life, and each of
them has what may be called a special line of
business of his own. In the course of their duty,
some of them mix with the receivers of stolen
goods, others with thieves, many with what are
called in Paris commercial rascals, and not a few
with those whose ‘industry’ it is to melt silver
and other property of a like valuable nature.
Forgers, sharpers of all kinds, housebreakers and
horse-stealers—a very numerous class in Paris—have
each all their special agents of the police,
who watch them, and know where to lay hands
upon them when they are wanted. A French
detective who cannot assume and act up to any
character, and who cannot disguise himself in
any manner so effectually as not to be recognised
even by those who know him best, is not considered
fit to hold his appointment. Their ability
in this way is marvellous. Some years ago, one
of them made a bet that he would in the course
of the next few days address a gentleman with
whom he was acquainted four times, for at least
ten minutes each time, and that he should not
know him on any occasion until the detective
had discovered himself. As a matter of course,
the gentleman was on his guard, and mistrusted
every one who came near him. But the man
won his bet. It is needless to enter into the
particulars. Suffice it to say that in the course
of the next four days he presented himself in
the character of a bootmaker’s assistant, a fiacre-driver,
a venerable old gentleman with a great
interest in the Bourse, and finally as a waiter
in the hotel in which the gentleman was staying.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
